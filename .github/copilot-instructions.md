# Copilot instructions

## For Angulars

- use the inject method instead of a constructor
- make use of signals where possible
- make use of the Control Flow
- prefer template driven forms over reactive forms
- use signal inputs and outputs
- we're using standalone by default, don't add standalone properties to decorators
- when adding components set the change detection to ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
- always add a type to buttons

## When writing tests

- don't use the "should" form
- don't nest tests
