For Angular:
    - use the inject method instead of a constructor
    - make use of signals where possible
    - make use of the Control Flow
    - prefer template driven forms over reactive forms
    - use signal inputs and outputs
    - don't add standalone: true
    - when adding components set the change detection to ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
